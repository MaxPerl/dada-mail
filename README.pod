=head1 Dada Mail

=head1 Introduction

Dada Mail is a contemporary, mature and intuitive web-based
email list management system.

Dada Mail handles Closed-Loop Opt-in subscriptions, sending
complex announce-only and/or discussion mailing list messages with an
advanced, fault-tolerant mass mailing monitor, supports the
archiving/viewing/searching/resending/syndicating (rss, atom feeds) 
of sent messages and doing all this and a whole lot more with style.

Dada Mail can handle custom subscriber fields and searching these fields, allowing you to send mass mailing to only part of your mailing list.  Dada Mail's email templating system allows you to create targeted and
completely custom email messages (mail merging) for each and every one one of your subscribers.

Dada Mail is bundled with additional plugins and extensions to extend
Dada Mail's capabilities. Some of the plugins/extensions support
advanced bounce handling, clickthrough tracking, mass mail scheduling,
blog interfaces of archived messages, AJAX subscription form trickery
and lots of other surprises.

Dada Mail produces HTML5 web content and sticks to best practices
when creating email messages. Write Once: Distribute Everywhere. Dada
Mail is free software that you're able to use, modify, share and enhance
under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Dada Mail is written
in Perl because we love Perl.

Dada Mail's system requirements are minimal: it runs as a CGI script (running under FastCGI and PSGI are also options), requires only Perl 5.10.1, supports multiple SQL backend flavors, bundles all of its CPAN Perl module dependencies, and comes with a web-based installer. Download/Upload the distro, run the installer script. 

Dada Mail works well in shared hosting environments thanks to its mass sending throttling capabilities. Dada Mail can also work well with large mailing lists that can utilize a third party email service, like Amazon SES. 

=head1 Building Dada Mail 

If you're pulling Dada Mail from its repository, you'll have to build the app to get it into a shape that will allow you to deploy it. 

First, download the repo, 

	git clone https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail.git

Then, run the bundled, C<make_distro.pl> script, 

	cd dada-mail
	perl make_distro.pl 

Once the script is done running, two files will be created in the B<distribution> directory. 

Follow the directions at, L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/install_dada_mail.pod.html> to install the app using the two files created.

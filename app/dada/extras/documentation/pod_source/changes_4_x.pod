=head2 4.9.0

=head2 Summary 4.9.0

This release focuses on many parts of Dada Mail to optimize performance. Benefits of all this work include
faster mass sending speeds. Potentially must faster. 

=over

=item * Sending performance has been optimized. Less memory used, faster template parsing

=item * Amazon SES sending performance has also been improved

=item * New time and date template tags available

=item * HTML::Template::Pro support added. 

=item * Bounce Handler improvements, including per-list preferences and a "bounce score decay" feature.

=back

=head2 Features 4.9.0

=head3 Bounce Handler

=head4 Rename to: Bounce Handler

The Bounce Handler (Known in the past as, "Mystery Girl") has been renamed to simply, B<Bounce Handler>. I don't very much listen to the 
Yeah Yeah Yeahs anymore. 

The config variable C<$PLUGIN_CONFIGS> also referred to this plugin as, "Mystery_Girl" - as in this code snippet: 

	$PLUGIN_CONFIGS = { 

		Myster_Girl => {
			Server                      => undef,
			Username                    => undef,
			Password                    => undef,
			# ...etc

This has also been change to simply, C<Bounce_Handler>:

	$PLUGIN_CONFIGS = { 

		Bounce_Handler => {
			Server                      => undef,
			Username                    => undef,
			Password                    => undef,
			# ...etc

=head4 Set Scorecard Prefs per-list, instead of Globally

Bounce Handler preferences, including the Soft Bounce Score, Hard Bounce Score and Score Threshold 
are now set B<per mailing list>, instead of having to be set in the global config. 

=head4 Decaying Scores

Bounce Scores can now, B<decay>, or be reduced every time a mass mailing is sent out. This is to help
minimize scores from email addresses that temporarily have had problems with delivery, but are otherwise
valid email addresses.  An email address's bounce score will also now be automatically removed, if the score goes 
at or below, B<0>.

=head4 Bounce Scorecard Conveniently on the default screen

The Bounce Scorecard is now presented on the default screen for the bounce handler, instead of being shown on a separate screen. 
Navigating the scorecard is now a little more intuitive, as well. 

=head4 Forward bounces to List Owner

Bounce messages can now be forwarded to the List Owner, once the Bounce Handler has reviewed the message. 

=head4 SES Support

Dada Mail/Bounce Handler should now have support for Amazon SES sending. This is still marked as, B<Experimental> (as is SES support in total), but SES-specific rules have been whipped up. Please give us feedback!

=head3 HTML::Template::Pro support, Faster Template Rendering

C<HTML::Template::Pro> renders the templates that Dada Mail uses throughout the app, 
including HTML screens and custom email messages, much faster than what's included
with Dada Mail (C<HTML::Template>). C<HTML::Template::Pro> will need to be installed separately. 

See the features doc on C<HTML::Template::Pro> for more information: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-html_template_pro.pod.html>

=head3 Faster sending using Amazon SES

Dada Mail now uses a persistent HTTP connection when talking with Amazon SES. This can 
speed up sending by .3 - .7 seconds/I<message>. 

=head3 New Template Tags for Date/Time

Dada Mail now has support for various simple Date and Time formats to use in HTML and Email templates, 
as well support for more flexible/advanced C<strftime> formats:

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-email_template_syntax.pod.html#date_related_tags>

=head3 New import script, dada_archives_backup_to_sql.pl

This script allows you to import archive data from the backup of a DB File, to the SQL backend. This helps if your 
DB Files are corrupted/incompatible with your current server environment. 

=head2 Changes 4.9.0

=head3 Documentation Updates

A new/update entry in the General FAQ, I<Tuning Dada Mail to Send Mass Mailings Faster>:

=head3 LWP unbundled

The C<LWP> group of Perl modules is no longer available with Dada Mail. C<LWP> is used for
such things as, B<Send a Webpage> and some web services, like B<Amazon SES>. You 
will have to install C<LWP> yourself. Most shared hosting companies will have this already installed, 
for you. 

=head3 MIME::Tools upgraded to v5.502

This upgrade to MIME::Tools has a very positive improvement on sending speed. 

=head2 Bugfixes 4.9.0

=head3 Unsub Notices when removing addresses from the email come with unsub link?

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/240

=head2 4.8.4

=head2 Summary 4.8.4

This release consists of fixes for issues found in the 4.8.3 release.

Of large note is a big memory leak found and fixed in v4.8.4 that happens 
whenever you mass mail an HTML email message, regardless of how it was first created. 

This memory leak could grow to many 100's of megabytes to gigabytes of memory 
within a few thousand messages sent and could potentially kill off the sending 
process and more likely than not, slow down mass mailing by ~10% (potentially 
 much greater, depending on how large the amount of RAM is consumed). 

For more information, see this issue:

=head2 4.6.0

=head2 Summary 4.6.0

v4.6.0 includes experimental subprojects, like Amazon SES support and unsubscribe tag/link 
flexibility, as well as updates and refinements to the default mailing list message templates, 
social bookmarking links, forward to a friend functionality, as well as a new plugin called, B<Mailing Monitor> 

=head2 Features 4.6.0 

=head3 Amazon SES Mail Sending Support

Amazon SES allows you to send email messages with Dada Mail using the Amazon 
SES Web Service. This service could potentially allow someone running a website with 
a small mailing quota send out mass mailings to a very large list, utilizing Amazon's 
services.

This feature is currently labeled, I<Experimental>. We need feedback. 
We want to make the feature better. Give us feedback!

=head4 See Also: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/features-amazon_ses_support.pod.html>

=head3 Forward to a Friend

It's now possible to place a, "Forward to a Friend" link into your mailing list messages. 

The Forward to a Friend form is available to both subscribers as well as visitors
to your mailing list archives. 

=head4 More Information: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/features_forward_to_a_friend.pod.html>

=head2 Unsubscribe Tag/Link Flexibility

You can now change the behavior of what Dada Mail does, 
after a user clicks the Unsubscriber Link. 

=over

=item * The unsubscription request can either be automatically processed, 

=item * or you may have the subscriber submit a unsubscription form. 

=back

The second option is hoped to thwart absent-minded clicks, as well as auto link prefetching.
 

This feature is currently labeled, I<Experimental>. We need feedback. 
We want to make the feature better. Give us feedback!

=head3 New Plugin: Mailing Monitor

The, B<Mailing Monitor> plugin replaces the, C<auto_pickup.pl> extension. 

Compared to the old extension, the Mailing Monitor plugin has a nicer list control panel interface and much more simplified instructions. 

The C<auto_pickup.pl> extension will still be shipped with Dada Mail, but will simply be a redirect to this new plugin. 

=head4 See Also: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/mailing_monitor.cgi.html>

=head3 Install Plugins/Extensions with the Dada Mail Installer

The installer that comes with Dada Mail now supports the installation of most of the 
plugins and extensions that come with Dada Mail.

The installer also gives you the option, when used to upgrade your current Dada Mail,  to either keep your current C<.dada_config> file, or to create a new C<.dada_config> file,  while also keeping your current C<.dada_files> directory structure and contents.

=head2 Features 4.5.0

=head3 New Plugin! Tracker

Tracker is the heir to the once venerable but now quite rickety I<clickthrough_tracking.cgi> 
plugin, rewritten to be better at everything I<clickthrough_tracking.cgi> was supposed to be 
good at. 

Tracker tracks the following Mass Mailing events: 

=over

=item * # subscribers when a mass mailing was sent out

=item * # of recorded clickthroughs 

=item * # of recorded opens/views

=item * # bounces, both soft and hard

=back

Tracker also allows you to automatically track all the links in your mass mailing messages
(instead of having to do everything manually) and provides very fancy charts/graphs of the 
information it compiles, for easy digestion. 

=head4 More Information

See the Documenation for the B<Tracker> plugin at: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/tracker.html>

=head2 Changes 4.5.0 

=head3 clickthrough_tracker.cgi plugin removed

Replaced with the Tracker plugin, which is tons better.

Dada Mail ships with a limit of 3 (instead of 5) mailing lists and a limit of 
10,000 subscribers (instead of 25,000) quotas by default. We encourage you to 
use Pro Dada, if you need more than that: L<https://dadamailproject.com/purchase/pro.html>

=head2 Changes 4.4.3

=head3 Clickthrough Tracking Redirect Tags Now Support mailto: URLS

v4.4.2 introduced stricter checking of the redirect tags, to make sure they look 
like URL's. This essentially broken any redirects that didn't start with, http://, https:// or ftp:// (there's a few others, as well) 

One redirect that was being used by some users was a B<mailto:>, like this: 

 mailto:user@example.com

or, 

 <a href="[redirect=mailto:user@example.com]">Email Us!</a>  

Support for such redirects has be re-introduced.

=head3 ajax_include_subscribe.cgi - set the mailing list you want the form to use, by query string parameter

In the, C<ajax_include_subscribe.cgi> script, you had the choice of either creating a form that allows you to 
show ALL lists available, or set a configuration variable within the script, to only show one list by default. 

You may now set whichever list you would like the subscription form to use, via the, C<list> query string parameter: 

 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/extensions/ajax_include_subscribe.cgi?list=mylist"></script> 
 
to show a subscription form for just that list. This works better than setting it within the extension, as you have the 
choice of making a specific subscription form, for any of your lists. 

=head3 Documentation Move Dada Mail Between Servers/Accounts

In the List Control Panel, if you remove addresses from your mailing list, the number of addresses that are then black listed is now displayed, instead of just mysteriously being added. 

=head3 Bounce Handler: Erase the Scorecard in the list control panel 

You can now erase the Bounce Scorecard on a list-per-list basis in the list control panel.

=head2 Changes 4.4.0

=head3 Closed-Loop Opt-In Subscription Not Enforced by Default, Anymore

In v4.3.0, Closed-Loop Opt-In Subscription model was applied in Dada Mail to mailing list by default
and by default you were not able to change these list settings to tailor it to your needs, without 
first changing the config variable, C<$ENFORCE_CLOSED_LOOP_OPT_IN> to, C<0>. 

It was also noted that in future versions of Dada Mail, features that did not conform 
to Closed-Loop Opt In would be removed from Dada Mail.

The, C<$ENFORCE_CLOSED_LOOP_OPT_IN> variable is now shipped with a value of, C<0> by 
default, making Dada Mail's behavior the same as pre-4.3.0 versions of Dada Mail.

We're also opening up the dialogue to all users of Dada Mail on how they see is the best way 
to balance power and versatility of Dada Mail, with accountability and adherence of the rules 
of a legitimate mailing list. We will put on hold the plan to deprecate these features, until 
we got more feedback from the users of Dada Mail. Please join the discussion: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/boards/viewtopic.php?flavor=25&t=2457>


=head3 Code Cleanup

Code cleanup has trimmed 500+ lines from the mail.cgi file. Many of the changes can be seen from 
moving from the C<DADA::MailingList::Settings::save> method to the, C<DADA::MailingList::Settings::save_w_params> method 
and from moving from the C<DADA::Templates::Widgets::screen> sub to the C<DADA::Templates::Widgets::wrap_screen> sub. 

=head2 Mass Mailing: Better Error Reporting

One problem when sending mass mailings - especially one using Dada Mail's templating system, is
that you may make an error when using the template tags. This was a difficult error to even know about, 
since no reporting was made, if an error was found - Dada Mail would simply error out and your message 
would seem to be, "stuck" in the mass mailing queue, forever. 

Now, many syntax errors should now be caught when sending a mass mailing, a webpage, or a list invitation. 

=head3 Dada Bridge: Reply and Reply-All Behavior 

Dada Bridge has simplified some of its options to make it more inline with other
discussion mailing list apps, when it comes to discussion lists. You now have two choices: 


* Have replies always be addressed to the mailing list (with an option to reply-all), or, 

* Have replies addressed to the discussion list


=head3 View List: "Open List in New Window" button renamed to, "Download List"

The list will also be given back as a CSV file, so most likely, you'll get a little dialog box asking if you
want to either open it in some application, or just download it. 

=head3 View List: Email Your List Button is Gone

You may still download your mailing list in csv format. 

=head3 Log View: Download the Raw Log

You can now download the entire log file, through the log viewer. 

=head3 Installer: Old Screen Cache Files Removed

If you use the installer to upgrade Dada Mail (as it is noted you may do), old
screen cache files will be removed, so that old information/templates won't be shown, with 
the newer version of Dada Mail. 

=head3 Template System: initial "tmpl_set support",  template wrapping

There's initial support for what's called the, B<tmpl_set> template tag, that basically 
allows you to set a variable within your template, to be used somewhere else within your 
template. 

This is interesting when coupled with initial support with wrapping one template, with another. 

In one way, Dada Mail already supports this - many template screens you see use either the default 
list template, or the default admin template and add content to another template inside it. 

Internally, this was done in a very kludgey way and has now been cleaned up. There could be a potential for a 
33% speedup for screen creation (which is nice)  

What has also been cleaned up is a problem with the title of many HTML screens in Dada Mail 
being saved within the program files itself. You can now set the title of the HTML screen 
from within the template that gets wrapped. You'll see a line like this near the top of 
many of the templates: 

 <!-- tmpl_set name="title" value="I am a title!" -->

Since moving to this way of setting the title for HTML screens, many, many of the 
templates have been changed. If you've made custom changes to the templates, you will want 
to do a diff on your version, with the version that ships with Dada Mail. 

=head2 AJAX: internal changes

Many instances of using a package called, C<CGI::Ajax> (http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Ajax/) 
has been replaced to use B<prototype> (http://www.prototypejs.org/)

The only place that CGI::Ajax is still being used is in the, ajax_include_subscribe.cgi 
extension - and we'll most likely remove it from there, soon as well. 

=head2 Mailing Monitor: AJAX

The Mailing Monitor in the list control panel is now refreshed via AJAX, so that 
only a portion of the screen you see needs to be updated, instead of a refresh of the entire 
screen. This seems to make things appear much more snappy. 

=head2 Subscription/Unsubscription Custom URL Redirect API Change

If there's an error with a subscription/unsubscription request, Dada Mail would 
add a list of the errors it came across by passing them in query string with a parameter named, C<errors>. 
This name has been changed to, C<errors[]> to help out php folk. This is tied to this bug: 

L<https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues#issue/109>

=head2 Web Services Examples

Examples for initiating a subscription request have been updated and added to. Currently there are
server/client examples in SOAP and REST. There's also a command line example. Profile Fields are now
support for all clients and servers. 

The example scripts can be found in the distro, at: 

I<dada/extras/scripts/subscribe>

Documentation can be found at: 

I<dada/extras/documentation/pod_source/COOKBOOK-subscriptions.pod>
I<dada/extras/documentation/html_version/COOKBOOK-subscriptions.pod.html>

=head2 Test Mass Mailings, Mail Merging

If the email address you're using has a profile, its fields ("First Name", "Last Name", etc) 
will be used in test mass mailings, instead of not using any fields. This is also true if the list
owner email has their own profile. 

=head2 Bug Fixes 4.4.0

=head3 blank "Verify" screen when adding/removing addresses in the list control panel 

https://github.com/justingit/dada-mail/issues/closed#issue/113

There seems to be a few small problems with both the add/remove verification screens,
if the information given is not formed correctly.

Among things that can cause problems:
* Invalid comma separated values format 
* blank lines 
* blank lines, except for spaces 
* incorrect information - such as HTML.
This HTML will then be viewed in the verification screens, without the HTML be escaped.


This causes a lot of problems with submitting addresses, as there isn't any notification, 
by Dada Mail that anything is wrong, except part of the screen having no information, what so ever.

They include a server written in Perl and clients written in Perl and php. They are also documented in the Subscription Cookbook

They are, in fact, Proof of Concepts and are not complete applications. 

=head3 Plugin: mx_lookup.cgi cleaned up

The B<mx_lookup.cgi> plugin has been cleaned up and documentation added. It's currently 
listed as, B<DEPRECATED>, but will not go away, until the functionality it has is brought into 
the core of the program. It's still a good example of how to make a simple Dada Mail plugin. 

=head3 Code Cleanup

Dada Mail, so we had to pull support for it. 

=head3 Habeas Watermark Support Removed

The Habeas Watermark isn't really used, anymore, anyways. 

=head2 Features 4.3.0

=head3 Dada Bridge: Ignore/Send a Rejection message for Spam Messages

It's now possible to either ignore messages seen as spam, or send a rejection message. 

=head3 Unsubscription Confirmations: Email Notice

If someone attempts to unsubscribe an email address that isn't actually 
subscribed, a notification will be sent, via email to the address, instead of having 
a notice in the browser. This is to keep the privacy of the subscriber. 

This behavior can be enabled/disabled in the list control panel, in, 

I<Your Mailing List  - Mailing List Options> 

Under the option, 

B<If someone not currently subscribed to your mailing list attempts to unsubscribe, send a, "You are not Subscribed!" message via email, instead of showing this error in their web browser.>

It is B<disabled> by default.

=head3 Closed-Loop Opt-In Subscription now Enforced by default

By default, the following features in Dada Mail are B<enabled>: 

=over 

=item * Closed-Loop Opt-In Subscriptions

=back 

By default, the following features in Dada Mail are I<disabled>: 

=over

=item * Subscribing Address via the List Control Panel without confirmation

(Invitations are still very much supported)

=item * Subscribing/Inviting Black Listed Addresses

(Black Listed subscribers may still subscribe themselves)

=item * Skipping the confirmation step for subscriptions if a user is logged into their profile

=back

These are options are set as such to closely follow Closed-Loop Opt-In Subscribing (meaning, a subscriber has to confirm a subscription themselves), 
which we think is the best way to run a email mailing list. 

The options to change these defaults that used to be available have been B<REMOVED> from the List Control Panel.  
You may still reveal these options by setting the Config variable, C<$ENFORCE_CLOSED_LOOP_OPT_IN> to, C<0>. We do not suggest this and we consider the above options B<DEPRECATED>. 

=head3 Email Message Templates Scanned for Correct Tags, Fixed if Missing. 

To make sure the subscription/removal systems in Dada Mail work correctly, Dada Mail will 
scan the user-editable email message templates, before it sends them out, to make sure they have the right tags, 
to perform the right actions. Here's a list of what tags are looked for, in which templates: 

=over

=item * List Subscription Confirmation Link

=over

=item * Subscription Confirmation Email

=item * List Invitation Message (PlainText) 

=item * List Invitation Message (HTML)

Although you may want to change this line if you're upgrade from v4.x.x to v4.3.0, you won't be required to

=head3 $MAILlING_LIST_MESSAGE

The variable, C<$MAILlING_LIST_MESSAGE> has been renamed to, C<$MAILING_LIST_MESSAGE>.
You will need to rename this varialbe in your C<.dada_config> file, if you are currently using it. 

Dada Mail will also alert the user of the missing tags in the List Control Panel, I<Appearance and Templates - Email Message Templates>

support. We'll see about supporting them, in the future. 

=head2 4.2.0

=head2 Changes 4.2.0

=head3 Dada Mail Installer

Dada Mail now comes with an installer - manually setting up and configuring
Dada Mail is now longer needed. Heavens be praised. 

Dada Installer directions may be found at: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/manually_install_dada_mail.pod.html>

Upgrade instructions may be found at: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/upgrade_dada_mail.pod.html>

The installar script may also be run via the command line - instructions can be 
found on how to use it, by invoking the script with the, C<--help> flag, 

 shell>./install.cgi --help

=head4 Installation Terminology Changes

The, "Advanced" Installation of Dada Mail is just known as a, "Manual" installation
of Dada Mail.

The Dada Mail Installer will install Dada Mail the same way as one would install 
Dada Mail manually. Directions may be found here: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/manually_install_dada_mail.pod.html>

The, "Basic" Installation method is not recommended or supported. If upgrading from a, "Basic" installation, 
it's recommended to move to a more contemporary installation setup: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/basic_to_contemporary_installation.pod.html>

=head2 Setup Info Screen 

The, "Setup Info" Screen, that you can access using this URL: 

L<http://example.com/cgi-bin/dada/mail.cgi?flavor=setup_info>

has been completely rewritten. In light of the Installer, it does not attempt to help 
configure Dada Mail for you, but will tell you what type of installation it recognizes, 
 will present to you the entire contents of your, C<dada/DADA/Config.pm> file as well as your C<.dada_config> 
file and will show you how all config variables are being interpreted. 

=head3 $ADMIN_MENU Changes 

The $ADMIN_MENU variable has been changed to add the, "Dada Mail Setup Info" menu item. It looks like this: 

	{-Title      => '<!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_NAME --> Setup Info',
	 -Title_URL  => "$S_PROGRAM_URL?flavor=setup_info",
	 -Function   => 'setup_info',
	 -Activated  => 1,
	},

=head3 MySQL 4-specific schema REMOVED

The MySQL schema shipped for Dada Mail, specifically for v4 of MySQL has been removed. 
The reason for the schema was more because of UTF-8 incompatibilities, rather 
than problems with this version of MySQL v4.

that are commonly viewed. 

=head4 Enabled by Default

The Screen Cache is enabled by default, via setting the C<$SCREEN_CACHE> config variable, to C<1> 

=head4 Changes to the $ADMIN_MENU

A new entry under the, "Plugins" heading has been added to the $ADMIN_MENU variable in the I<Config.pm>, 
I<dada/DADA/Template/templates/example_dada_config.tmpl> and, I<dada/extras/examples/example_dada_config.txt>

=head2 Changes 4.0.5

=head3 POP3 and SMTP Passwords Saved in List Settings 

I<This is not a security bug/issue/notice - rather, this is a bug that was introduced
with the full UTF-8 support.> 

The binary-in-nature encrypted passwords saved by Dada Mail in the List Settings 
table/files in Dada Mail may have become unusable/corrupted with version 4.0.3
and/or 4.0.4 of Dada Mail. 

If you are having trouble/an impossible time using any of the POP3 or SMTP connection
stuff in Dada Mail, including Dada Bridge, Mystery Girl (Bounce Handler) or POP-before-SMTP
and/or SMTP SASL authentication - or even the Twitter stuff, you may be bitten by this bug. 
4.0.5 should provide a fix for this problem, B<BUT> (big but), 4.0.5 could potentialy I<break any 
currently stored passwords>. 

The fix will be to simply re-save the correct password, I<after> you've upgraded to 
4.0.5. 

New users of Dada Mail will not be affected by this problem.  

This problem B<does not impact> your List Password, or the Dada Mail Root Password - 
both of which are saved in a one-way encryption, that is separate from the way 
POP3/SMTP passwords are saved in Dada Mail.

=head2 4.0.4

=head2 Changes 4.0.4

=head3 UTF-8 Issues

=head4 MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite schema changes

Some compatibility issues cropped up, regarding UTF-8/unicode character set/encoding 
in re: to the SQL schemas. The schemas for all supported SQL backends have been 
modified to better work, mostly by changing fields with type, C<text(320)>, to type, 
C<varchar(80)>. Other notes have been added to the UTF-8 FAQ. 

=head4 dada3_to_dada4_sql.pl changes

Along with looking into changing the default schema in Dada Mail, the v3 to v4
migration script will now make the necessary schema and character set changes. 

The character encoding changes and SQL schema changes could potentially be desctructive, 
so we do, in fact, highly encourage you to make a backup of the entire database, 
before running the migration tool. Most notably, the character encoding change 
does not work perfectly. If your data contains a lot of non-Latin1 characters, we'd 
highly suggest you do your own ASCII/Latin1 to UTF-8 migration, before upgrading 
your Dada Mail. 

If you are running a verion of Dada Mail 4.0.0 to 4.0.3, you'll still need to 
make those schema changes manually if you're having trouble (exactly what to do, 
including example SQL is located in the UTF-8 FAQ).

=head2 CPAN Modules 4.0.4

=over

=item * CGI::Sessoion upgraded to: 4.42

CGI::Session handles all session management in Dada Mail. 

=item * List-Utils Scalar-Utils

The CPAN perl modules, Scalar::Util and List::Util are included with Dada Mail, but aren't actively used (and are probably outdated),
 so that any server-wide installed versions will be used, instead. This is because the XS versions of these modules are needed for POP/SMTP 
SSL connections and having these usable by default, breaks SSL connections. The directories, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar

have been renamed, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/List-remove_to_install

and, 

 dada/DADA/perllib/Scalar-remove_to_install

renaming them back to their original name will make them, "active"

=back


=head2 4.0.3

=head2 Changes 4.0.3

=head3 Unicode/UTF-8 Work 

We have worked very, very hard to get Dada Mail working with UTF-8/Unicode.

We think we did a pretty good job and you'll have a most amazing experience
 when comparing this version to any previous version of Dada Mail (ever), but 
there may be tiny things still to work out. 

We need to know about them, don't be shy! 

=head4 SQL table schema changes!

People who upgrade to 4.0.3 (and any version afterwards, until things change!) 
should note that the MySQL and PostgreSQL Table Schemas have changed! 

You may need to update your own tables, to support UTF-8 (if they aren't 
already in that encoding).

=head4 See Also:

If you're upgrading, please read over the updated UTF-8/Unicode FAQ: 

https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-UTF-8.pod.html

If you're doing a new install, there's nothing you need to know, Dada Mail should
work well out of the box in re: to UTF-8/Unicode stuff. 

=head3 Changes to Default List Settings

We've changed a few of the default list settings, hopefully so that everyone 
has a more pleasant experience, right off the bat: 

=head4 Activate Black List

We've enabled the setting to active the Black List, by default. 

We're also enabling the below settings: 

=over

=item * Move Unsubscribed Subscribers Automatically to the Black List

=item * Continue to Allow Subscriptions From Subscribers of Black Listed Addresses

=back

You still have the option to change new lists to the previous behavior and already created lists 
will have their previous behavior, if Black List Settings have already been edited.  

=head3 Print List-Specific Headers option Removed

The option, B<Print List-Specific Headers> has been removed from, I<Mail Sending -Advanced Sending Preferences> 
has been removed, I<but> the functionality has B<not>. All 
mailing list messages will have these headers. 

=head3 Send Unsubscription Confirmation Emails (Closed-Loop Opt-Out) - disabled by default

B<Send Unsubscription Confirmation Emails (Closed-Loop Opt-Out)> has been disabled by default (you can still enable it) 

This option, when enabled, requires that when someone wants to unsubscribe, 
they have to confirm this unsubscription by clicking on the unsubscription confirmation link
in a URL sent their subscribed address. 

When disabled (the new default), they simply have to fill out the subscribe/unsubscribe form. 

=head2 Subscription and Unsubscription links now include an Email Address

When available, both the Subscription and Unsubscription links will have the potential subscriber's
(or unsubscriber's) email address in the link itself, so that the user does not have to do the two-step
of first following the link and then typing in their email address. 

These links are created per-subscriber (or potential sub/unsub), when you use the: 

 <!-- tmpl_var list_subscribe_link -->

or, 

 <!-- tmpl_var list_unsubscribe_link --> 

tags. Previously, these tags only provided a link to the subscription/unsubscription form, 
without the email address embedded within the link itself. There is no way to revert this behaviour, 
but you can still roll your own links, like this: 

Subscription Link: 

 <!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_URL -->/s/<!-- tmpl_var list_settings.list --> 

Unsubscription Link: 

 <!-- tmpl_var PROGRAM_URL -->/u/<!-- tmpl_var list_settings.list -->

=head2 Unsubscription Links Now Mandatory for Mass Mailing Messages

Dada Mail will now do a quick check to make sure that there is a Dada Mail 
Unsubscription link in your mass mailing messages, before sending them out. 

If one is not found, one will be automatically appended to the end of your message. 

It will not be very fancy. 

We suggest that you make sure that you have a real, valid, Dada Mail unsubscription link
in your Mailing List Messages.

=head3 Dada Bridge: "Allow Open Discussion List" option always viewable

For whatever reason, the, "Allow Open Discussion List" option wasn't viewable, until
you first enabled discussion lists. It will now *always* be viewable, as long as the 
Plugin Config Param, C<Allow_Open_Discussion_List> is set to, C<1>

=head3 Dada Bridge: New Plugin Config Param: Check_Multiple_From_Addresses

A new Plugin Config Paramater called, C<Check_Multiple_From_Addresses> has been added
and has a default value of, C<1>. When enabled, messages that have more than one 
sender aren't supported by Dada Bridge and these messages will be ignored. 

Set this parameter to, C<0> to revert to the previous behavior. 

=head3 Mail Sending - "broken pipe" catch removed

Dada Mail had a very simple test to make sure mail using the sendmail command was successful, 
by looking at any error messages created from sending mail this way. If a, "broken pipe" 
message was found while sending a mass mailing, a mass mailing would be stopped, 
and would be picked up and sending would be attempted starting at the same address
that gave the error. The complete logged error may look like this: 

	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: Pro Dada 4.0.1 Warning: 
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi:                          didn't close pipe to '|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -fbounces@example.com' while 
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi:                          attempting to send a message to: '"My Mailing List" <me@example.com> because:' Broken pipe at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: Broken Pipe error! returning -1 - Mass Mailing should be exit()ed! at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808
	[Mon Jan  4 16:40:08 2010] mail.cgi: [listshortname]  Mailout:<20100104164007.54315974@nicky510.com> Bailing out of Mailing for now - last message was unable to be sent! exit()ing! at ..//DADA/MailingList/Schedules.pm line 808

This behavior is problematic, since the, "broken pipe" error can happen, even 
if a message (or part of a message) is actually sent. Sometimes this happens if you 
have a message that contains a dot by itself on one line, like this: 

 .

If this is problematic to you (messages being cut off because of a lone dot on one line) 
and you're using the sendmail command to send messages, consider changing the C<$MAIL_SETTINGS> 
and, C<$MASS_MAIL_SETTINGS> Config variables to include the, C<-i> flag, like this: 

 $MAIL_SETTINGS      = "|$MAILPROG -t -i";
 $MASS_MAIL_SETTINGS = "|$MAILPROG -t -i";

=head2 4.0.0 Features

=over

=item * Multiple List Sending

Support has be re-introduced to allow Multiple List Sending. See the separate docs on this feature: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-multiple_list_sending.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profiles

Please see the docs specifically about Dada Mail Subscriber Profiles:

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/feature-profiles.pod.html>

=item *  Subscriber Profile Field Labels

You can now have a, "Label" to your Subscriber Profile Field. A label is what's 
visibly shown and is not now created from the field's name.

=item * Subscription Approval System (Experimental) 

You can now have an, "open to all to subscribe" mailing list, that still requires approval from the list owner. 

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-subscription_approval.pod.html>

=item * Slightly better UTF-8 support. 

This version of Dada Mail is currently shipped with all charsets and encodings to, "UTF-8", but Dada Mail itself is far from support this character set completely. 

This is because it is hard.

Please see the docs specifically about this new feature: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-UTF-8.pod.html>

=item * Twitter Support

Yup. Dada Mail can Tweet. More information: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/features-twitter_support.pod.html>

=item * CKeditor Support (Experimental) 

We're experimenting with bringing CKeditor support to Dada Mail. Please see the embedded Config.pm docs about this: 

L<https://dadamailproject.com/support/documentation/Config.pm.html#ckeditor_integration____ckeditor_url__experimental__>

=item * Mass Mailings keep their own log

This means, that anything about the mass mailing is logged for that specific mass mailing - 
this should hopefully make debugging a little bit easier. 

=item * View the Mass Mailing Log from the Mailing Monitor

There's a new link entitled, "Open Mass Mailing Log in a New Window -> "

This functionality is currently extremely rough, but is a pretty easy way to see what, in fact, is going on. 

=item * Slightly Smarter Error Handling for failing sendmail mailings

We've started catching sendmail errors and, if we find an error, we'll exit out of the 
sending process, for the message to be automatically picked up and the last email 
that had a problem, to be tried again. It's currently not perfect, but it's a very small 
step forward.

=item * Clone Settings

You can now clone the settings from one list, to another list, in the, "Create a New List" screen. 

=item * Remove All Subscribers

You can now Remove all subscribers at once in the, I<Manage List - View Subscribers> screen. 

=item * prototype.js/Scriptalicious Support

For the most part, AJAX stuff in Dada Mail has been replaced by the prototype.js 
and Scriptalicious Javascript Libraries. 

=item * Black List Matching

If it wasn't clear or official before, it should be now:

The black list matching does not work with matching strings, but will only work to 
match the user or domain of an email address or the entire email address. These are valid black list entries: 

=over

=item * matchthis@

=item * @matchthis

=item * matchthis 

=item * matchthis@example.com

=back


=item * Plugins Beatitude - Fetch message from URL has same options as, "Send a Webpage" 

Mostly meaning, you can embed images within the email message itself. 

=item * Plugins Mystery Girl

You can now specify the Port Number of the POP3 mail server

=item * Plugins - Dada Bridge

Simple moderation support is included, to Authorized to moderate messages. 

=item * Plugins - Clickthrough Tracker

The Clickthrough Tracker now has a new SQL backend option for the URL redirect list. 

The log is still in PlainText. 

=item * Extensions - Update Subscriptions - REMOVED

The update_subscriptions.cgi extension has been removed, as its features have been superceded by the Dada Profiles
feature. And then some. 

=back

=head2 CPAN Perl Libraries 

The CPAN Perl Libraries needed for Dada Mail are now being saved within the 
Git Repository of Dada Mail. We don't know if this is the greatest idea, since we don't 
really plan on making changes to this modules. But, we're doing it. If any problems 
occur, please report!

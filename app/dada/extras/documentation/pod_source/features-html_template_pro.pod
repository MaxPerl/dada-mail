=head1 HTML::Template::Pro support in Dada Mail

=head2 Introduction

Dada Mail has been using the C<HTML::Template> CPAN module for rendering its HTML screens, 
as well as providing the templating engine for its email messages. It works really great. 

C<HTML::Template::Pro> is a compatible module, that can now be used as a drop-in replacement for 
C<HTML::Template> in Dada Mail. It features faster rendering speeds (up to 10x faster) and less memory usage.

Since it is used for the email templates in Dada Mail, using C<HTML::Template::Pro> instead of 
the included C<HTML::Template> can significantly speed up mail sending.

=head2 Installing HTML::Template::Pro

If you do not already have the C<HTML::Template::Pro> module installed, you may 
grab it via CPAN. See our FAQ on how to install CPAN Perl Modules:

=head2 Configuring Dada Mail to use HTML::Template::Pro

Once C<HTML::Template::Pro> is installed, there's nothing else you need to do, to start using C<HTML::Template::Pro> with Dada Mail. 

You can disable using C<HTML::Template::Pro>, if you so desire.  See the docs for the C<$TEMPLATE_SETTINGS> 
config variable:

L<https://dadamailproject.com/d/global_variables.pod.html#_template_settings>, specifically, the, C<engine> parameter.
